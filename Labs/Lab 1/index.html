            I study accessibility, wearable technology, and build assistive technologies. As an accessibility and human-computer interaction researcher, I explore how technology can be used to understand human ability and support empowerment, independence, and improved quality of life. My research has focused on understanding user needs and designing technology systems that enhance and leverage the full potential of users with diverse abilities. While I spend a majority of my time on assistive technologies, I am also interested in web development, user experience, and physical computing.

            I'm a fifth year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University - <span class="hcii"> Human Computer Interaction Institute </span>,
            where I'm advised by Anind Dey and Mayank Goel. I work at the intersection of Human-computer Interaction,
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Health. I create systems and methods with the goal of understanding 
            human behavior and improving people's wellbeing. Towards this goal, I have worked in projects on Stress, 
            Activity Recognition and interruptibility detection. I'm currently focused on the personalization 
            of health interventions using a combination of AI, wearables and a smartphone.I have also worked 
            on novel input interaction techniques like keyboard surface interaction and gestures detection 
            using a smartwatch.

            I'm a doctoral student researcher at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA (expected graduation: 2023).
            Advisors: Laura Dabbish and Jason Hong.
            My thesis-directed research lies in the human factors of cybersecurity, in two parallel tracks:

-understanding people's security attitudes and behaviors in a social context (such as predicting whether they will keep software updated and explaining ignorance of UX cues to "fake news"), and
-empowering people to keep themselves and their networks secure in a social context (such as defining needs and creating tools to better enable account sharing by couples or workgroups).
Current project: Social Cybersecurity. We apply social influence and gamification techniques to boost adoption of end user security tools and best practices. This is sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation under grant no. CNS-1704087.
